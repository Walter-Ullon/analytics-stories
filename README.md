# analytics-stories
Case studies (in python) from Wayne L. Winston's book "Analytics Stories".

https://www.amazon.com/Analytics-Stories-Using-Things-Happen/dp/1119646030

Each chapter presents a case in which analytics helped unravel a story and answer:
1. what happened?
2. what will happen?
3. why did it happen?
4. how do I make good things happen?

While the author provides all of his analyses for each chapter in excel, here we seek to provide the python equivalent in the form of jupyter notebooks. 

Whenever possible, we fill in the gaps and provide additional insights, analysis, and visualizations, and do a deeper dive.

Please note that not every chapter will be featured.
